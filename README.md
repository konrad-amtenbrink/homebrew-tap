# Homebrew Tap

This repository contains a collection of my Homebrew (aka, Brew) "formulaes". Brew is a simple package manager for OS X that's based on Git.

## Usage

First, add this tap to your Brew:

    brew tap konrad-amtenbrink/tap

Next, draft from the tap:

    brew install konrad-amtenbrink/tap/<formula>

Third, enjoy your new brew.
